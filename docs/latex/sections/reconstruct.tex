\subsection{Source Tree Reconstruction}

Occasionally, it may be useful to reconstruct the original source tree
structure. Two utility tools have been created to do so: \gufitracedir
and \gufiindexdir. As their names imply, they take in traces and index
and convert them back into source directories, with files and
symlinks. Note that currently, files are created and left with the
size at 0. They are not set to their real sizes because users likely
do not have the storage space available to them. Files with hole are
not created with \texttt{fallocate(2)} in order to not use
non-portable functions. This may change in the future.

\texttt{gufi\_index2trace} is not available because the functionality
can be achieved by calling \texttt{gufi\_query -o <trace name> -S
  ``SELECT * FROM summary;'' -E ``SELECT * FROM entries;''
  /path/to/index} and optionally combining the resultant trace
files. Note that if more than 1 thread is used, writing to per-thread
traces files is required in order to guarantee that each
directory and its contents are written out as a single stanza.

    state/.style={draw = black, circle, minimum width = 2cm, very thick},
    arrow/.style={black, ->, line width = 2pt}

\begin{scope}[on grid]
\node[state] (dir)   {dir};
\node[state] (trace) [below right=6cm and 5cm of dir] {trace};
\node[state] (index) [right=10cm of dir] {index};
\end{scope}

\path (dir)   edge [arrow, bend right = -20] node [midway, above] {\gufidirindex}   (index);
\path (index) edge [arrow, bend left  =  20] node [midway, above] {\gufiindexdir}   (dir);

\path (dir)   edge [arrow, bend right = -20] node [midway, below] {\gufidirtrace}   (trace);
\path (trace) edge [arrow, bend left  =  20] node [midway, below] {\gufitracedir}   (dir);
