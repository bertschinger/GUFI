\subsection{\gufisqlite}
\gufisqlite is a simple program that imitates most of the
\texttt{sqlite3} cli while providing GUFI specific functions. The
main difference from the \texttt{sqlite3} cli is that ''dot commands''
are not supported.

\subsubsection{Flags}
\begin{table} [H]

  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Flag & Functionality \\
    \hline
    -h & help manual \\
    \hline
    -d \textless delim\textgreater & delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E] \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\gufisqlite Flags and Arguments}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Usage}
\gufisqlite \texttt{[options] [db [SQL]...]}

If no SQL statements are passed in, SQL statements will be read in from stdin

\subsection{\querydbs}
\input{sections/querydbs}

\querydbs was once its own C program, but has been converted to a
wrapper around \gufisqlite. Features available in \gufisqlite imply
their availablility in \querydbs.
