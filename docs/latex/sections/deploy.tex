\section{Deployment}
\label{sec:deploy}
GUFI functionality as described so far has been local. However, users
are not expected to log into the machine containing the indexes with
an interactive shell. Instead, users are expected to call the
scripts installed with the client RPM from a client node to forward
commands to the server via ssh.

\subsection{RPMs}
When CMake is configured with \texttt{-DCLIENT=On}, \texttt{make
package} will produce two RPMs instead of one. The server RPM will
contain the actual GUFI implementation. The client RPM will contain
renamed and modified \guficlient wrapper scripts.

\subsubsection{Wrapper Scripts}
\gufiquery provides the core GUFI functionality. However it is not
expected to be used by users, as the syntax of \gufiquery is somewhat
unwieldy, and users are not expected to understand how GUFI
works. Wrapper scripts such as \gufifind and \gufils were created in
order to provide users (and administrators) with predetermined queries
that are used often and extract useful information (see the user guide
for more details). The server has the actual implementation of the
wrapper scripts while the client has multiple copies of \guficlient
renamed to the cooresponding script's name.

\subsection{SSH}
\subsubsection{Authentication}
Normal ssh, using passwords or user keys (\texttt{\textasciitilde
  /.ssh/id\_rsa}), should be disabled on the server. Instead, ssh
should be done using host based authentication
(\texttt{/etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_rsa\_key}).

\subsubsection{\gufijail}
\label{sec:gufi_jail}
A restricted shell should be set up on the server to prevent arbitrary
command execution.

\gufijail is a simple script that limits the commands users logging in
with ssh are able to run to only a subset of GUFI
commands. \texttt{/etc/ssh/sshd\_config} should be modified with the
following lines:

\begin{verbatim}
    Match Group gufi
        ForceCommand /path/to/gufi_jail
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Runtime Configuration}
The wrapper scripts on both the server and client require a valid GUFI
configuration file to function correctly. The path to the
configuration file can be set at configure time with the
\texttt{CONFIG\_FILE} CMake variable (defaults to
\guficonfigfile). The configuration file will be readable by all users
but should only be writable by the administrators (664 permissions) in
order to prevent non-admin users from changing how GUFI runs.

GUFI configuration files are simple text files containing lines of
\texttt{<key>=<value>}. Duplicate configuration keys are overwritten
by the bottom-most line. Empty lines and lines starting with \# are
ignored. The server and client require different configuration
values. Example configuration files can be found in the
\texttt{config} directory of the GUFI source, as well as in the build
directory. The corresponding examples will also be installed with
GUFI.

\subsubsection{Server}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Key & Value Type & Purpose \\
  \hline
  Threads & Positive Integer & Number of threads to use \\
  & & when running \gufiquery. \\
  \hline
  Query & File Path & The absolute path of \gufiquery. \\
  \hline
  Sqlite3 & File Path & The absolute path of \gufisqlite. \\
  \hline
  Stat & File Path & The absolute path of \gufistatbin. \\
  \hline
  IndexRoot & Directory Path & The absolute path of a GUFI tree \\
  & & (or parent of multiple indexes). \\
  \hline
  OutputBuffer & Non-negative Integer & The size of each per-thread
  buffer \\
  & & used to buffer writes to stdout. \\
  & & Setting this too low will affect \\
  & & performance. Setting this too high \\
  & & will use too much memory. \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Key & Type & Purpose \\
  \hline
  Server & URI & The URI of the server (IP address, URL, etc.) \\
  \hline
  Port & Non-negative integer & Port number \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Colocating the Server and Client}
Colocating the server and client can be done, with some points to keep
in mind:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Installing both the server and client with
    \texttt{make~install} is currently not supported. There is an
    issue with CMake's \texttt{install} command that prevents clean
    \texttt{make~install} and RPM generation at the same
    time. Instead, the client wrapper scripts should be run out of the
    GUFI build directory. There, the client wrapper scripts will be
    called \texttt{gufi\_client\_<name>}, e.g.,
    \texttt{gufi\_client\_ls}. Because of the rename, it does not
    really make sense to colocate the server and client for anything
    other than testing even if the client wrapper scripts are
    installed.
  \item The server and client configurations should be placed into the
    same file as both the server and client read from the same
    configuration file path.
\end{itemize}
