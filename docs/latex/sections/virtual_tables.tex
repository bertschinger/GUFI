\subsection{Virtual Tables}
A series of
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html}{\sqlite~Virtual~Tables} have
been developed for GUFI.

\subsubsection{\gufivtstar and \gufivt}
\gufivttreesummary, \gufivtsummary, \gufivtentries, \gufivtpentries,
\gufivtvrsummary, and \gufivtvrpentries, collectively known as
\gufivtstar, and \gufivt wrap \gufiquery to present indexes as a
single \sqlite table. This allows for indexes to be used by \sqlite
wrappers such as SQLAlchemy.

These virtual tables are available in \gufisqlite, and as a runtime
loadable extension (same file).
\\\\
\indent \gufivtstar virtual tables have fixed schemas and are directly usable
as
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#tabfunc2}{table-valued~functions}. They
take in only the index path and number of threads.
\\\\
Example Usage:
\begin{verbatim}
(
    echo "SELECT * FROM gufi_vt_pentries(`/path/to/index', 2);"
) | gufi_sqlite3
\end{verbatim}

\indent \gufivt allows for arbitrary queries to be run on an index and have
the results presented as a single table. However, because the table
schema is not known beforehand, the virtual table must be set up
before being used.
\\\\
Example Usage:
\begin{verbatim}
(
    echo "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE temp.output" \
         "USING gufi_vt(index=/path/to/index, threads=2," \
         "E=`SELECT name, size FROM pentries');"
    echo "SELECT * FROM output;"
) | gufi_sqlite3
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{\runvt}
\runvt is the generic virtual table that runs input commands with
\texttt{popen(3)} and converts each line of the output into a row of a
\sqlite table.

\runvt is available in \gufiquery, \gufisqlite, and as a runtime
loadable extensions.
\\\\
Example Usage:
\begin{verbatim}
(
    echo "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE temp.output " \
         "USING run_vt(cmd=`cat file.csv', " \
         "d=`,', cols=`name, size');"
    echo "SELECT * FROM output;"
) | gufi_sqlite3
\end{verbatim}
