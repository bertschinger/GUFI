/*
 * GPFS Inode scan, partitioned
 *
 * This program scans a contiguous chunk of inodes in a GPFS filesystem at args.path.
 * The range is delimited by [args.min, args.max] (inclusive).
 *
 * Multiple threads are launched according to args.n_threads.
 * Each thread is given a contiguous chunk from the overall range scanned by this program.
 *
 * Inodes whose mtime is newer than args.newer_than are printed to stdout.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 *     $ gpfs_inode_scan_partitioned /gpfs/ --newer_than 1771531335 --min 1000000 --max 2000000 -n4 | wc -l
 *     thread 1 chunk: [1250000, 1499999]
 *     thread 0 chunk: [1000000, 1249999]
 *     thread 3 chunk: [1750000, 2000000]
 *     thread 2 chunk: [1500000, 1749999]
 *     thread 2 processed 14336 nodes, of which 13312 (92.86%) were new.
 *     thread 0 processed 21504 nodes, of which 19456 (90.48%) were new.
 *     thread 1 processed 25955 nodes, of which 21504 (82.85%) were new.
 *     thread 3 processed 33943 nodes, of which 27631 (81.40%) were new.
 *     Total inodes processed: 95738
 *     Total new inodes: 81903 (85.55% of total)
 *     81903
